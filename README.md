CFIDictaphonicWindow
====================

Use Mountain Lion's dictation feature for enqueuable programmer-defined commands.

Warning
=======

Don't use this in a production app as of yet.  It is merely here for entertainment purposes.  If you're going to use it,
be sure to only enqueue blocks that are associated with short, preferrably 1-word, commands.  Remember that the dictation
depends on ML's ability to reason with it's servers, so any false positives or bad results are not the fault of the control.
