## CFIDictaphonicWindow ##
Use Mountain Lion's dictation feature for enqueuable programmer-defined commands.

## Warning ##

Don't use this in a production app as of yet.  It is merely here for entertainment purposes.  If you're going to use it,
be sure to only enqueue blocks that are associated with short, preferrably 1-word, commands.  Remember that the dictation
depends on OS X's ability to reason with it's servers, and this control provides no fault-checking, so any false positives 
or bad results are not the fault of the control.
